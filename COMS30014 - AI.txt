What are the tree key parts of a Prolog/Datalog Program?&nbsp;	Facts: <br>movie(american_beauty, 1999).<br><br>Rules: <br>released_after(M,Y) :- movie(M,Z), Z &gt; Y.<br><br>Queries:<br>?- actor(_, A, _), director(_, A)
How can this be procedurally interpreted?&nbsp;<br><br>vintage(A) :- (actor(M,A,_) ; actress (M,A,_)), movie(M,Y), Y&lt;1970.	<div>To find a vintage movie star, it suffices to find an actor or actress A who played a role R1 or R2 in some movie M, find the year Y of its release, and check it was before 1970.</div>
What is wrong with this query?&nbsp;<br><br><div>vintage(A) :- Y&lt;1970 , (actor(M,A,_) ; actress (M,A,_)) , movie(M,Y).</div>	Variable Y is unbound when called, as querys execute left to right, this causes an error.&nbsp;
What are the classical logic versions of these Prolog operators:<br>&nbsp;:-&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\+&nbsp;	If, And, Or, Not
Transitive Closure is ...	One element is reachable from another by chaining applications of a base relation. (The property that allows you to make recursive calls that end in a base case).

<div>quality of partial solutions into account (e.g. using heuristics)</div>"
What is the Prolog implementation of Depth-First Search?	"<div><b>search_df([Goal|Rest],Goal):-</b></div>
<div><b>&nbsp; goal(Goal).</b></div>
<div><b>search_df([Current|Rest],Goal):-</b></div>
<div><b>&nbsp; children(Current,Children),</b></div>
<div><b>&nbsp; append(Children,Rest,NewAgenda),</b></div>
<div><b>&nbsp; search_df(NewAgenda,Goal).</b></div>"

What is Iterative Deepening?&nbsp;	Depth-First Search but limit depth at each stage<br>Combines optimality of BFS and Memory Benefits of DFS
How does Best-First Search interate?&nbsp;	<div>• <b>Agenda Type:</b> Priority Queue</div><div>• <b>Adding Children:</b> You do <b>not</b> simply append children to the back. Instead, you evaluate them using a heuristic metric and <b>merge/insert</b> them into the agenda to maintain the sorted order (putting the node with the best/lowest score at the front).</div><div>• <b>Behaviour:</b> Depends entirely on the heuristic employed (determines optimality, speed, etc.).</div>
What does A Search aim to minimise?	Aims to minimise the total cost of solution paths via some node n using a metric (aka f score) which combines cost of reaching current node with cost of moving to next node.&nbsp;<br><br>f(n) (cost along path through n)<br>g(n) (cost to reach current node n-1)<br>h(n) (cost to go from n-1 to n)<br><br>f(n) = g(n) + h(n)<br><br>if g(n) == 0 (for all n) then you have Greedy Best first<br>if h(n) == 0 (for all n) then you have BFS&nbsp;
What is Global Optimism?&nbsp;	A heuristic is globally optimistic if the estimated cost of reaching a goal is always less than the actual cost (from any node n). i.e Eucledian Distance in GridWorld

<div>neighbourhood of the current solution</div><div><br></div><div>Non-Stochastic</div>"
<div>How does Simple Tabu Search work at a high level?&nbsp;</div>	"<div>Same as Hillclimb, but don’t consider solutions on a (finite) list of</div>
<div>previously visited solutions.&nbsp;</div><div>In addition, as it picks the&nbsp;<b>best</b>&nbsp;solution, it can also traverse downwards.&nbsp;</div>"
<div>How does the Simulated Annealing algorithm work?</div>	"<div>Same as Hillclimb, but tolerate moves to worse solutions with a probability</div>

What is Rank-Proportionate Selection in GA?&nbsp;	You pick each parent with a change proportional to the rank of the fitness in the population.&nbsp;<br>Each individual has equal probability of being in a 'tournament', pick N.<br>Each 'tournament' produces one 'fittest' individual.&nbsp;<br>Run K 'tournaments'.&nbsp;
What are the two genetic operators applied during reproduction?&nbsp;	Mutation: Each offspring allele is replaces by a random allele with prob m.<br>(Asexual + Sexual)&nbsp;<br>Almost always used (typically 1 mutation per offspring)<br><br><br>Crossover: The offspring genotype inherits genes from multiple parents.<br>(Sexual)<br>(Sometimes not used at all (Asexual Reproduction))
What is Elitism?	The fittest current individual is copied into the next generation perfectly.&nbsp;
What are the 3 types of Crossover?	"One-Point: The offspring inherits the first K genes from the mothers genotype and remainder from fathers.<br><img src=""Screenshot 2025-12-07 at 12.44.09.png"">"

How does a Generational GA keep a constant population size N?&nbsp;	Continue selection and reproducing parents until we have N new offspring. Then discard old population and replace with N new individuals.&nbsp;
How does Steady-State Reproduction keep population size N constant?&nbsp;	As soon as we have generated one new offspring, we pick a member of curr population and kill it.

What are the 3 distinct types of Modality in Fitness Landscapes?&nbsp;	Unimodal: There is only one optimium (global) - Each gene has a best allele independent of all alleles at al other genes.<br><br>Bimodal: There are two optimums the best allele for some genes depends on the alleles at some other genes.&nbsp;<br><br>Multimodal: Many basins of attraction for many optima - lots of dependencies.
What is a Deceptive Landscape?&nbsp;	"The best optima have small basins, consequently global optima is hard to find.<br><img src=""Screenshot 2025-12-07 at 14.20.25.png"">"
Why are GAs more equipped for more challenging landscapes than regular search methods?&nbsp;	They maintain and evlove a <b>population</b> of solutions not just a single one like Hill-Climber.&nbsp;
What is Evolutionary Drift?&nbsp;	A form of 'confusion' when trying to find an o[timal genotype. If multiple genotypes have equal fitness, evolution cannot choose between them (population can become split and never fully converge).
What is the Quasi-Species Concept?	Hight GA mutation rates mean that the evolving population is a cloud of points on the landscape (a quasi-species).<br>If the selection pressure on the population to reward good solutions is overcome by mutation pressure then the population effectivley cannot 'see' the needle.
What is Epistatis?&nbsp;	Epistasis is the interaction or dependency between different genes.<br>For instance if the fitness of one gene depends on another gene, you have epistatis. If every gene adds value independently (linear) there is zero episasis?&nbsp;
What is modularity?&nbsp;	It is the 'inverse' of epistasis. Full modularity means each instance is independent of all other instances. No modularity means each instance is dependant of all other instances which means the solution has high epistasis.<br><br>TLDR: Modularity is inverse of Epistatis
