What are the key features of the first wave of HCI?	<ul><li>1980s-1990s</li><li><div>HCI&nbsp;as&nbsp;an&nbsp;applied&nbsp;science,&nbsp;grounded&nbsp;in&nbsp;lab&nbsp;research​</div></li><li><div>An&nbsp;information&nbsp;processing&nbsp;perspective,&nbsp;from cognitive&nbsp;psychology<br></div></li></ul>
What were the broad theoretical approaches in the first era of HCI?	<ul><li>using isolated ideas from basic science disciplines</li><li>applying theories from basic science disciplines&nbsp;</li><li>developing new HCI-specific theory, grounded in lab science disciplines&nbsp;</li></ul>
What are the pros and cons of using isolated ideas from basic science research?	<ul><li>easy to remember</li><li>lack detail and discrimination</li><li>not clear how to develop further</li></ul><div>The 'Magical Number Seven, Plus-Or-Minus Two' is an example.</div>
What is an example of applying&nbsp;theories from basic&nbsp;science&nbsp;disciplines?	Paired&nbsp;associate&nbsp;theory​.<br>For example, command&nbsp;names&nbsp;should&nbsp;be familiar&nbsp;and&nbsp;have&nbsp;some&nbsp;natural link&nbsp;with&nbsp;the&nbsp;invoked&nbsp;process​.
What is Fitt's Law?	A formula that predicts the time required to move to a target based on the target's distance and size.
What does GOMS stand for?	Goals,&nbsp;Operators,&nbsp;Methods&nbsp;and&nbsp;Selection&nbsp;rules
What is GOMS?	A model to predict performance time for skilled users on input tasks<sup></sup><sup></sup><sup></sup><sup></sup><sup></sup>. It decomposes a user's task into atomic actions and assigned times, based on information processing models from cognitive psychology<sup></sup><sup></sup><sup></sup><sup></sup><sup></sup><sup></sup><sup></sup><sup></sup><sup></sup>.
What do&nbsp;Goals, Operators, Methods, and&nbsp;Selection all mean?	<ul><li>GOALS:&nbsp;what&nbsp;the&nbsp;user&nbsp;wants&nbsp;to&nbsp;do​</li><li>OPERATORS:&nbsp;individual&nbsp;actions​</li><li>METHODS:&nbsp;how&nbsp;to&nbsp;combine&nbsp;actions&nbsp;to achieve&nbsp;the&nbsp;goal​</li><li>SELECTION&nbsp;RULES:&nbsp;how&nbsp;to&nbsp;choose&nbsp;between potential&nbsp;METHODS&nbsp;of&nbsp;the&nbsp;task</li></ul>
What are the five limitations/assumptions of GOMS?	<div><ul><li>No&nbsp;fatigue​</li><li>No&nbsp;learning&nbsp;(expert&nbsp;users)​</li><li>No&nbsp;errors&nbsp;(expert&nbsp;users)​</li><li>All&nbsp;tasks&nbsp;are&nbsp;goal-directed​</li><li>Goal&nbsp;is&nbsp;clear&nbsp;at&nbsp;start&nbsp;of&nbsp;the&nbsp;task&nbsp;(no&nbsp;problem solving)</li></ul></div>
What is the Gulf of Execution and the Execution Bridge?	The mismatch between the user's intentions (or goals) and the actions allowed by the interface.<br><br>Bridging the Gulf of Execution requires making functions discoverable and ensuring the available actions align with the user's expected actions (making sure the Required Action Plan matches the Expected Action Plan).
What is the Gulf of Evaluation and The Evaluation Bridge?	The Gulf of Evaluation is the mismatch between the system's actual state and the user's ability to perceive, interpret, and evaluate that state against their original goal. It is the user's struggle to figure out whether an action worked.<br><br>Bridging the Gulf of Evaluation requires providing clear, immediate, and easily interpretable feedback that matches the user's expectations.
