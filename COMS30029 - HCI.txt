What are the key features of the first wave of HCI?	<ul><li>1980s-1990s</li><li><div>HCI&nbsp;as&nbsp;an&nbsp;applied&nbsp;science,&nbsp;grounded&nbsp;in&nbsp;lab&nbsp;research​</div></li><li><div>An&nbsp;information&nbsp;processing&nbsp;perspective,&nbsp;from cognitive&nbsp;psychology<br></div></li></ul>	
What were the broad theoretical approaches in the first era of HCI?	<ul><li>using isolated ideas from basic science disciplines</li><li>applying theories from basic science disciplines&nbsp;</li><li>developing new HCI-specific theory, grounded in lab science disciplines&nbsp;</li></ul>	
What are the pros and cons of using isolated ideas from basic science research?	<ul><li>easy to remember</li><li>lack detail and discrimination</li><li>not clear how to develop further</li></ul><div>The 'Magical Number Seven, Plus-Or-Minus Two' is an example.</div>	
What is an example of applying&nbsp;theories from basic&nbsp;science&nbsp;disciplines?	Paired&nbsp;associate&nbsp;theory​.<br>For example, command&nbsp;names&nbsp;should&nbsp;be familiar&nbsp;and&nbsp;have&nbsp;some&nbsp;natural link&nbsp;with&nbsp;the&nbsp;invoked&nbsp;process​.	
What is Fitt's Law?	A formula that predicts the time required to move to a target based on the target's distance and size.	
What does GOMS stand for?	Goals,&nbsp;Operators,&nbsp;Methods&nbsp;and&nbsp;Selection&nbsp;rules	
What is GOMS?	A model to predict performance time for skilled users on input tasks<sup></sup><sup></sup><sup></sup><sup></sup><sup></sup>. It decomposes a user's task into atomic actions and assigned times, based on information processing models from cognitive psychology<sup></sup><sup></sup><sup></sup><sup></sup><sup></sup><sup></sup><sup></sup><sup></sup><sup></sup>.	
What do&nbsp;Goals, Operators, Methods, and&nbsp;Selection all mean?	<ul><li>GOALS:&nbsp;what&nbsp;the&nbsp;user&nbsp;wants&nbsp;to&nbsp;do​</li><li>OPERATORS:&nbsp;individual&nbsp;actions​</li><li>METHODS:&nbsp;how&nbsp;to&nbsp;combine&nbsp;actions&nbsp;to achieve&nbsp;the&nbsp;goal​</li><li>SELECTION&nbsp;RULES:&nbsp;how&nbsp;to&nbsp;choose&nbsp;between potential&nbsp;METHODS&nbsp;of&nbsp;the&nbsp;task</li></ul>

What is the Gulf of Execution and the Execution Bridge?	The mismatch between the user's intentions (or goals) and the actions allowed by the interface.<br><br>Bridging the Gulf of Execution requires making functions discoverable and ensuring the available actions align with the user's expected actions (making sure the Required Action Plan matches the Expected Action Plan).	
What is the Gulf of Evaluation and The Evaluation Bridge?	The Gulf of Evaluation is the mismatch between the system's actual state and the user's ability to perceive, interpret, and evaluate that state against their original goal. It is the user's struggle to figure out whether an action worked.<br><br>Bridging the Gulf of Evaluation requires providing clear, immediate, and easily interpretable feedback that matches the user's expectations.	
What is Situated Action?	It is an approach that posits that human actions are not pre-planned. Instead, actions are caused by the immediate circumstances of the situation moment-by-moment.&nbsp;	
What does Suchman mean by Indexicality?	"The meaning&nbsp;of&nbsp;actions&nbsp;and&nbsp;communication depends&nbsp;on the context around&nbsp;us.<br>&lt;Person pointing to a button&gt; ""Try pressing this"""	
What does Suchman mean by Ad Hoc?	<div><div>Plans&nbsp;are&nbsp;generalised&nbsp;across multiple contexts,​ but actions/solutions&nbsp;are&nbsp;specific&nbsp;to contexts.</div></div>	
What does Suchman mean by Mutual Intelligibility?	Understanding&nbsp;each&nbsp;other&nbsp;is&nbsp;not&nbsp;to&nbsp;be&nbsp;taken&nbsp;for&nbsp;granted​.&nbsp;Communication involves many tiny&nbsp;breakdowns&nbsp;and&nbsp;repairs. We must support repair and clarification in our technologies.	
How might you apply the Situated Action approach to a study?	<ul><li><div><div>Record&nbsp;behaviours&nbsp;and&nbsp;conversations​</div></div></li><li><div>Follow&nbsp;user&nbsp;to&nbsp;study&nbsp;their&nbsp;actions</div></li><li><div>Study&nbsp;the&nbsp;same&nbsp;tasks&nbsp;in&nbsp;diﬀerent&nbsp;contexts</div></li><li><div>Focus on deviations and irregularities</div></li><li><div>Don't trust what people plan to do</div></li></ul>	
What are the situated action design principlies?	<ul><li>Allow systems to infer context</li><li>Clarify the machine's limitations to the user</li><li>Support ad hoc coordination between users</li><li>Build in opportunities for repair after breakdowns have occurred</li><li>Allow&nbsp;alternative&nbsp;courses&nbsp;of&nbsp;action<br></li></ul>	
What is phenomenology?	Simply, its the idea that we view objects differently when they don't do what we expect them to.	
What is ready-to-hand?	The tool is transparent to us. We are completely engaged in the task.<br>Typing on your own laptop is an example.	
What is present-at-hand?	The tool becomes obtrusive because we encounter an obstacle to our task.<br>An example is a key on the keyboard getting stuck.	
What is unready-at-hand?	It is somewhere between ready and present. The technology is working but awkwardly.&nbsp;<br>An example is typing on someone else's laptop.	
What is an affordance?	The attributes of an object that allow a person to perform an action	
How are affordances in virtual objects identified by people?	<ul><li>Convention</li><li>More obvious visual clues</li><li>Cultural constraints</li><li>Physical constraints</li><li>Logical constraints</li></ul>	
What is a perceptible affordance?	The&nbsp;interface&nbsp;element&nbsp;oﬀers&nbsp;information&nbsp;about&nbsp;how&nbsp;it may&nbsp;be&nbsp;acted&nbsp;upon	
What is a false affordance?	Conveying&nbsp;the&nbsp;impression&nbsp;that&nbsp;an&nbsp;interface&nbsp;element does&nbsp;something,&nbsp;but&nbsp;does&nbsp;something&nbsp;unexpected instead​	
What is a correct rejection of an affordance?	When there is no affordance and nothing indicating there might be.	
What did the third wave of HCI focus on?	<ul><li>Humanistic perspectives<br></li><li>The user's overall experience, including non-useful aspects like pleasure and play<br></li><li>Ethics and values<br></li><li>Social conscience</li></ul>	
What are the four parts of the Hook model?	<ul><li>Trigger -&nbsp;initiator to perform some behaviour</li><li>Action - get the user to respond with some action</li><li>Variable Reward - slightly different value reward each time, sometimes none</li><li>Investment - build loyalty by making the users feel the time they spent was useful</li></ul>	
What are practical qualities?	How usable, practical, functional, supportive, adaptable, useful something is	
What are hedonic qualities?	How pleasurable, fun, interesting, stimulating, exciting something is	
How can we quantify hedonic qualities?	Make users score along two axes - valence (good or bad) and arousal (high or low energy).	
What are flow states?	Positive experiences where you become completely absorbed in an activity that is intrinsically motivating and enjoyable<sup></sup><sup></sup><sup></sup><sup></sup>. You feel focused and in control, and will lose track of time<sup></sup>.	
How can you support flow states?	<ul><li>Balance between challenge and difficultly</li><li>Clear goals</li><li>Unambiguous feedback</li></ul>	
What does it mean if something is extrinsically good?	It is good for the sake of something else	
What does it mean if something is intrinsically good?	It is good for its own sake. It is&nbsp;integral to the thing.	
What are the basic needs in self-determination theory?	Autonomy -&nbsp;the need for connection to other people, or a sense of belonging<br>Competence -&nbsp;the need to feel ability and mastery over tasks<br>Relatedness -&nbsp;the need for things to be in line with your goals and values<br>If an activity satisfies the basic needs, it will be intrinsically motivating.	
How do you support the basic needs in self determination theory?	<ul><li>Avoid external pressure​</li><li>Avoid arbitrary rewards ​</li><li>Informational feedback to support sense of competence​</li><li>Support connection to others​</li><li>Help users connect it to their values</li></ul>	
What is cognitive tracing?	The ability to manipulate representation to project structure onto things, then act on those projections.&nbsp;<br>Eg. a list of tasks vs a kanban board	
What is&nbsp;Distributed Cognition?	The idea that problem-solving doesn't just happen inside one person's head. Its spread over:<br><ul><li>People - teams sharing info</li><li>Tools and Objects - notes, dials, computers, lists</li><li>The Environment - the physical and social setup</li></ul>	
What is an external representation in distributed cognition?&nbsp;	A tool or interface that either stores information or helps to process it, moving the cognitive work out from inside a person's head.	
What is Activity Theory?	It looks at an entire activity (driven by a motive)<sup></sup>, not just isolated actions. It models how a person (the subject) uses tools&nbsp;<sup></sup><sup></sup><sup></sup><sup></sup>to work towards a goal (the object), all within a wider social context of rules, community, and division of labour<sup></sup><sup></sup><sup></sup><sup></sup>.<br>(It's low-key rooted in Marxism btw)	
What is the hierarchical structure of an activity?	<ol><li>Activity - driven by a motive</li><li>Actions - driven by goals</li><li>Operations - determined by the conditions</li></ol>	
What is internalisation and externalisation?	Internalisation: when actions transform into operations (like when you become an expert)<br>Externalisation: when operations transform into actions (like when there's a breakdown)	
What are the types of contradictions in activity theory?	Primary: Within a single component<br>Secondary: Between different components<br>Tertiary: Within different version of the same activity<br>Quaternary: Between different activity systems	
What are the two types of GOMS analysis?	"<span style=""text-decoration-line: initial;"">KLM-GOMS - simple, adds up individual actions<br></span>CPM-GOMS - complex, allows for parallel actions"	
What is disability studies?	A field of critical inquiry focused on the lived experience of disabled people, and the societal, medical and intellectual policies and rhetoric concerned with disability (Mankoff et al. 2010)	
What is the difference between person-first and identity-first language?	"Person-first - ""a person with a disability""<br>Identity-first - ""disabled person"""	
What is the medical model of disability?	<ul><li>Focuses on the physical and functional limitations a person may demonstrate</li><li>Disability is within the individual<br></li><li>Assistive technologies are fixes<br></li></ul>	
What is the social model of disability?	"<ul><li>Focuses on barriers imposed by social/cultural environment that
contribute to disabling a person<br></li><li>Disability is located in the social environment<br></li><li>Tries to fix attitudes</li></ul>"	
What is the predicament model of disability?	It recognises disability as a complex situation, rather than solely a medical deficit or a social construct.	
What is the double empathy problem?	A theory suggesting that social communication difficulties between autistic and non-autistic people are mutual, not a one-sided deficit.	
<div>What is Interaction as Dialogue?</div><div></div><div></div>	Interaction is a cyclic process of communication acts (turns) between the user and the computer<sup></sup><sup></sup><sup></sup><sup></sup>.	
<div>What is Interaction as Transmission?</div><div></div><div></div>	Interaction is the transfer of information (messages/bits) between a sender and receiver over a noisy channel with limited capacity<sup></sup><sup></sup><sup></sup><sup></sup>.	
<div>What is Interaction as Tool Use?</div><div></div><div></div>	Interaction is the manipulation of a tool to affect change in the world or extend human capabilities<sup></sup><sup></sup><sup></sup><sup></sup>.

<div>What is Interaction as Embodied Action?</div><div></div><div></div>	Interaction is being and participating in the world, emphasising the first-person lived experience and situated context<sup></sup><sup></sup><sup></sup><sup></sup>.	
<div>What is Interaction as Experience?</div><div></div><div></div>	Interaction is an ongoing stream of feelings, expectations, and memories, shaped by cognitive appraisals<sup></sup><sup></sup><sup></sup><sup></sup>.	
<div>What is Interaction as Control?</div><div></div><div></div>	Interaction is a dynamic system where the user minimises error against a reference (goal) state via feedback loops<sup></sup><sup></sup><sup></sup><sup></sup>.	
What is a situated action?	It is an approach that posits that human actions are not pre-planned. Instead, actions are caused by the immediate circumstances of the situation moment-by-moment.&nbsp;
