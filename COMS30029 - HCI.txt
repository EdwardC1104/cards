What are the key features of the first wave of HCI?	<ul><li>1980s-1990s</li><li><div>HCI&nbsp;as&nbsp;an&nbsp;applied&nbsp;science,&nbsp;grounded&nbsp;in&nbsp;lab&nbsp;research​</div></li><li><div>An&nbsp;information&nbsp;processing&nbsp;perspective,&nbsp;from cognitive&nbsp;psychology<br></div></li></ul>
What were the broad theoretical approaches in the first era of HCI?	<ul><li>using isolated ideas from basic science disciplines</li><li>applying theories from basic science disciplines&nbsp;</li><li>developing new HCI-specific theory, grounded in lab science disciplines&nbsp;</li></ul>
What are the pros and cons of using isolated ideas from basic science research?	<ul><li>easy to remember</li><li>lack detail and discrimination</li><li>not clear how to develop further</li></ul><div>The 'Magical Number Seven, Plus-Or-Minus Two' is an example.</div>
What is an example of applying&nbsp;theories from basic&nbsp;science&nbsp;disciplines?	Paired&nbsp;associate&nbsp;theory​.<br>For example, command&nbsp;names&nbsp;should&nbsp;be familiar&nbsp;and&nbsp;have&nbsp;some&nbsp;natural link&nbsp;with&nbsp;the&nbsp;invoked&nbsp;process​.
What is Fitt's Law?	A formula that predicts the time required to move to a target based on the target's distance and size.
What does GOMS stand for?	Goals,&nbsp;Operators,&nbsp;Methods&nbsp;and&nbsp;Selection&nbsp;rules
What is GOMS?	A model to predict performance time for skilled users on input tasks<sup></sup><sup></sup><sup></sup><sup></sup><sup></sup>. It decomposes a user's task into atomic actions and assigned times, based on information processing models from cognitive psychology<sup></sup><sup></sup><sup></sup><sup></sup><sup></sup><sup></sup><sup></sup><sup></sup><sup></sup>.
What do&nbsp;Goals, Operators, Methods, and&nbsp;Selection all mean?	<ul><li>GOALS:&nbsp;what&nbsp;the&nbsp;user&nbsp;wants&nbsp;to&nbsp;do​</li><li>OPERATORS:&nbsp;individual&nbsp;actions​</li><li>METHODS:&nbsp;how&nbsp;to&nbsp;combine&nbsp;actions&nbsp;to achieve&nbsp;the&nbsp;goal​</li><li>SELECTION&nbsp;RULES:&nbsp;how&nbsp;to&nbsp;choose&nbsp;between potential&nbsp;METHODS&nbsp;of&nbsp;the&nbsp;task</li></ul>
What are the five limitations/assumptions of GOMS?	<div><ul><li>No&nbsp;fatigue​</li><li>No&nbsp;learning&nbsp;(expert&nbsp;users)​</li><li>No&nbsp;errors&nbsp;(expert&nbsp;users)​</li><li>All&nbsp;tasks&nbsp;are&nbsp;goal-directed​</li><li>Goal&nbsp;is&nbsp;clear&nbsp;at&nbsp;start&nbsp;of&nbsp;the&nbsp;task&nbsp;(no&nbsp;problem solving)</li></ul></div>
What is the Gulf of Execution and the Execution Bridge?	The mismatch between the user's intentions (or goals) and the actions allowed by the interface.<br><br>Bridging the Gulf of Execution requires making functions discoverable and ensuring the available actions align with the user's expected actions (making sure the Required Action Plan matches the Expected Action Plan).
What is the Gulf of Evaluation and The Evaluation Bridge?	The Gulf of Evaluation is the mismatch between the system's actual state and the user's ability to perceive, interpret, and evaluate that state against their original goal. It is the user's struggle to figure out whether an action worked.<br><br>Bridging the Gulf of Evaluation requires providing clear, immediate, and easily interpretable feedback that matches the user's expectations.
What is a situated action?	It is an approach that posits that human actions are not pre-planned. Instead, actions are caused by the immediate circumstances of the situation moment-by-moment.&nbsp;
What does Suchman mean by Indexicality?	"The meaning&nbsp;of&nbsp;actions&nbsp;and&nbsp;communication depends&nbsp;on the context around&nbsp;us.<br>&lt;Person pointing to a button&gt; ""Try pressing this"""
What does Suchman mean by Ad Hoc?	<div><div>Plans&nbsp;are&nbsp;generalised&nbsp;across multiple contexts,​ but actions/solutions&nbsp;are&nbsp;specific&nbsp;to contexts.</div></div>
What does Suchman mean by Mutual Intelligibility?	Understanding&nbsp;each&nbsp;other&nbsp;is&nbsp;not&nbsp;to&nbsp;be&nbsp;taken&nbsp;for&nbsp;granted​.&nbsp;Communication involves many tiny&nbsp;breakdowns&nbsp;and&nbsp;repairs. We must support repair and clarification in our technologies.
How might you apply the Situated Action approach to a study?	<ul><li><div><div>Record&nbsp;behaviours&nbsp;and&nbsp;conversations​</div></div></li><li><div>Follow&nbsp;user&nbsp;to&nbsp;study&nbsp;their&nbsp;actions</div></li><li><div>Study&nbsp;the&nbsp;same&nbsp;tasks&nbsp;in&nbsp;diﬀerent&nbsp;contexts</div></li><li><div>Focus on deviations and irregularities</div></li><li><div>Don't trust what people plan to do</div></li></ul>
What are the situated action design principlies?	<ul><li>Allow systems to infer context</li><li>Clarify the machine's limitations to the user</li><li>Support ad hoc coordination between users</li><li>Build in opportunities for repair after breakdowns have occurred</li><li>Allow&nbsp;alternative&nbsp;courses&nbsp;of&nbsp;action<br></li></ul>
What is phenomenology?	Simply, its the idea that we view objects differently when they don't do what we expect them to.
What is ready-to-hand?	The tool is transparent to us. We are completely engaged in the task.<br>Typing on your own laptop is an example.
What is present-at-hand?	The tool becomes obtrusive because we encounter an obstacle to our task.<br>An example is a key on the keyboard getting stuck.
What is unready-at-hand?	It is somewhere between ready and present. The technology is working but awkwardly.&nbsp;<br>An example is typing on someone else's laptop.
What is an affordance?	The attributes of an object that allow a person to perform an action
How are affordances in virtual objects identified by people?	<ul><li>Convention</li><li>More obvious visual clues</li><li>Cultural constraints</li><li>Physical constraints</li><li>Logical constraints</li></ul>
What is a perceptible affordance?	The&nbsp;interface&nbsp;element&nbsp;oﬀers&nbsp;information&nbsp;about&nbsp;how&nbsp;it may&nbsp;be&nbsp;acted&nbsp;upon
What is a false affordance?	Conveying&nbsp;the&nbsp;impression&nbsp;that&nbsp;an&nbsp;interface&nbsp;element does&nbsp;something,&nbsp;but&nbsp;does&nbsp;something&nbsp;unexpected instead​
What is a correct rejection of an affordance?	When there is no affordance and nothing indicating there might be.
