What is a Camera Obscura?	"More commonly known as a pinhole camera, setup with light hitting a plane, passing through a pinhole and being projected, inversed, on the wall behind.&nbsp;<img src=""Screenshot 2025-12-09 at 12.41.55.png"">"
In a Camera Obscura, what is the relationship between pinhole size and projected image?&nbsp;	- Smaller pinhole: less light, sharper<br>- Larger pinhole: more light, reduces sharpness
How are digital images aquired?	Light enters camera and hits sensors, these register the average intensity&nbsp;and output a sampled image. The sharpness of the image depends on the resolution of the sensor plane and the point spread function.
What is Shannon Sampling Theorum?	You may fully reconstruct a signial containing compnents up to some maximum frequency u by regularly sampling at least 2u samples per second.&nbsp;
What is the Dirac Delta-Function?&nbsp;	"A function which mathematically defines how sampling of a signal occours.<br><img src=""Screenshot 2025-12-09 at 12.51.06.png""><br><br>delta{t} = inf at t == 0<br>and 0 at t /== 0"
How are correlation and convolution kernels applied to an signal?&nbsp;	Correlation kernels are directly applied, wheras convolution kernels are applied, mirrored, (i.e top-left -&gt; bottom-right, top-right -&gt; bottom-left etc.)
When applying a blur, what must you do as the last step?&nbsp;	"Normalise the result by dividing by the values by the absolute values of the kernel.&nbsp;<img src=""Screenshot 2025-12-09 at 14.29.26.png"">"

What is the relationship between the sigma value and the amount of blur in a Gaussian Filter?&nbsp;	Higher sigma causes an increased blur.
Is the Gaussian Kernel seperable?&nbsp;	Yes the filter is seperable into two 1D filters, one for rows and one for columns and takes the computation down from O(M<sup>2</sup>N<sup>2</sup>) to O(M<sup>2</sup>N), a significant speed up.

What is the LoG?	Laplacian of a Gaussian is the functional use of the Laplacian Sharpening filter. As the Laplacian is so sensitve to noise its always paired with the Gaussian Blur.&nbsp;<br><br>This works due to the associative nature of convolution!<br><br>When using this pair, its more computationally effiecnt to apply the Gaussian filter to the Laplacian Filter before applying to it the image in one go instead of applying each individually.&nbsp;

What is the Convolution Theorem?	"Convolution in the spacial domain is equivalent to multiplication in the frequency domain.&nbsp;<br><br>This is relevant as you can transform both the kernel and image to freq domain, pixelwise multiply them together and then inverse transform to get the convolved image.&nbsp;<br><br>We dont need to know the concrete method for doing this.&nbsp;<br><img src=""Screenshot 2025-12-09 at 21.39.51.png"">"

Are the sobel and prewitt operators invriant to rotation?&nbsp;	NO, most effective at horizontal and vertical, can detect diagonal but as they are square kernels, this models a step-like diagonal edge. If you rotate a vertical line by like 1 degree the accuracy of the edge detection will decrease.&nbsp;
What does a point in the image plane tranlate to in the<b>&nbsp;parameter</b>&nbsp;space and why?&nbsp;	A point tranlates to a line in the parameter space: many lines of differing m and c all cross the same point in image space.&nbsp;

&nbsp;What is the Interative Threshold Selection algorithm, and how does it work?&nbsp;	It is an algorithm used to determine good threshold values for segmenting images using their pixel intensity histograms.&nbsp;<br><br>Method:&nbsp;<br>- Select an initial eltimate for T<br>- Segment the image using T. This produces two groups of pixels: G<sub>1</sub>&nbsp;consisting of all pixels with grey lev &gt; T and G<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;consisting of the rest.<br>- Compute the average grey level values M<sub>1&nbsp;</sub>and M<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;for G<sub>1</sub>&nbsp;and G<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;<br>- Compute new threshod value T = (M<sub>1 </sub>+&nbsp;M<sub>2</sub>) / 2<br>- Repeat until convergence.<br><br>Intuitivley, cluster, find average of each cluster, find midpoint, repeat.
Does thresholding always work for image segmentation?&nbsp;	No! If images dont have a large range of pixel values and good contrast, Iterative Thresholding Algorithm struggles to find good values.
What is the Split and Merge algorithm and how does it work?	"This is another method for image segmentation and it revolves around breaking the image into smaller and smaller pieces and then remerging these peices depending on some condition. Formally:&nbsp;<br><br>- Start with R which represents the whole image and H the homogenity function.&nbsp;<br>- If H(R) == 0 then split area into 4 blocks and recusivley process each area again with H.&nbsp;<br>- When all regions are split. Merge all subregions that pairwise satisty H(R<sub>1</sub>&nbsp;U R<sub>2</sub>) == 1.<br><br>Works well for blocky images but for non -square shapes can cause a 'blocky' look.<br><br><img src=""Screenshot 2025-12-10 at 17.55.09.png"">"
